```php
$file = fopen("path/to/file.txt", "r");
if ($file) {
    // Process the file...
    fclose($file);
} else {
    // Handle the error...  This might be missing or insufficient
}
```
This code has a subtle issue. While it checks if `fopen` succeeds, it doesn't check for errors during file processing.  If an error occurs while reading or writing to the file (e.g., running out of disk space), `fclose` will be called, but the error condition during file processing will not be handled.
