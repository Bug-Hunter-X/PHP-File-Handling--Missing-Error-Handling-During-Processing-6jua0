# PHP File Handling Bug: Missing Error Checks During Processing

This repository demonstrates a common, yet easily overlooked, error in PHP file handling. The code opens a file successfully but lacks robust error handling during the actual file processing stage.  This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.

The `bug.php` file showcases the buggy code.  `bugSolution.php` provides the corrected version with improved error handling.

## Bug
The primary issue is the lack of error checking while reading or writing data to the file. While `fopen` is checked, potential errors later during file processing are ignored.

## Solution
The solution involves adding error checks after every file operation. This involves using functions like `feof`, `fgets`, and checking the return values of file operations for potential issues.  Appropriate error handling (e.g., logging or throwing exceptions) is implemented to manage errors gracefully.
